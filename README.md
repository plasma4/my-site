# My Silly Website
Everything on my [website](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/), in one place!

It includes:
* [Doodle Square](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/square.html) (a game where you create your own interactive levels)
* [Bee Incremental](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/bees.html) (an intriguing game that involves fish)
* [An interactive fractal viewer](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/fractal.html) (with lots of different fractals)
* [Information on big numbers](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/numbers.html) (from tetration to Rayo's Number, PLUS intersting info on the Fast-Growing Hierarchy)
* [A strange game involving stars](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/planet.html) (with stars and other stuff)
* [A weird little clock game](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/clocks.html) (with factories, electricity, metallic fruits and wood, and countless hours of content)
* A few other random projects here and there (uncompleted, like [this one](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/power.html) or a wonky [garden-related one](https://plasma4.github.io/my-site/garden.html) that I made a *long, long* time ago)

Well, go exploring now because I don't have much to say.
